# Anvil Tweaks
This simple mod aims to make anvils less frustrating. It removes the arbitrary "Too Expensive!" level cap when using an
anvil. It also nerfs the increasingly prohibitive prior work penalty. Repairs do become more expensive, but you will 
never pay more than 30 levels as a work penalty.
